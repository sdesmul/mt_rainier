# mt_rainier
This is my final project for my full stack web development class. This is the website for MTRainier Cattery.

To implement the object oriented portion I created 3 classes, Cat, Kitten(inherits from Cat), and Adult Cat

To implement validation I validated the email, name, and message type with PHP validation and javascript funtions.

To implement the connection I submitted the email, name, and message type to the database.
